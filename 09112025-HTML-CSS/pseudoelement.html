     <h1>Hello</h1>

     <p>My first day of college was a disaster; I got lost, went to the wrong class, and even missed my first quiz. I was supposed to be in geometry but ended up in a room full of upperclassmen for English, only realizing my mistake twenty minutes into the lecture. The rest of the day was no better, with a sneezing fit in botany causing me to leave the lab and a subsequent discovery that I had locked my keys in the car.</p>
